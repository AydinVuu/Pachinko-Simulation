Abstract:
This project investigates the dynamic interactions between 2D circular objects and various shapes similar to those in Pachinko machines and Peggle. The primary focus is on implementing realistic bouncing forces and physics simulations in a game-like environment. The project uses the Runge-Kutta 4th Order method for calculating ball states and features collision detection and response algorithms for both stationary balls and triangles. The simulation includes elements such as score tracking, game sound effects, and unlimited ball drops. Overall, the project aims to demonstrate an accurate and computationally efficient physics simulation for dynamic 2D interactions.
